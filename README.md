SpaceCompare is a Windows GUI tool which compares two [SpaceSniffer](http://www.uderzo.it/main_products/space_sniffer/) "Grouped by folder" snapshots and list which directories have increased in size.

SpaceCompare is still an early tool and is very buggy! Currently:

- All file sizes are given in bytes, making them hard to read
- Windows thinks the program has crashed while the file is loading

Both of these issues can be easily solved with time.

## Installation

SpaceCompare doesn't need to be installed!

1. Download the EXE from [releases](https://github.com/OrangeFlash81/SpaceCompare/releases)
2. Run it!

## Building

Clone this repo and use the `dotnet` command-line tool to handle running and building.
